/**
 * Hook Rules
 * There are 3 rules for hooks:
 *      1. Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
 *      2. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
 *      3. Hooks cannot be conditional
 * 
 * Note: Hooks will not work in React class components.
 * 
 * 
 * You cannot call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can call Hooks from React function components.
 * Hooks can also be called from custom Hooks.
 * Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
 * You can't use a hook inside another hook
